# 📄 Privacy Policy (Draft)

**Last Updated:** February 3, 2026

## 1. Introduction
Vibe Tokens ("we", "our") respects your privacy. This plugin operates primarily within your Figma file environment.

## 2. Data We Collect
*   **Figma File Data:** We access your file's variables and styles to perform token operations. This data processing happens locally on your device.
*   **AI Processing:** When you use the "Omnibox" or AI features, text prompts and relevant token context are sent to Google Gemini (via API) to generate responses. We do not store this data.
*   **Authentication:** We use Supabase to authenticate your "Pro" session. We only store your User ID and subscription status.

## 3. Data Storage
*   **Local Storage:** Your settings are stored in Figma's `clientStorage`.
*   **Encrypted Vault:** Sensitive keys (if any) are encrypted using zero-knowledge encryption on your device.

## 4. Third-Party Services
*   **Google Gemini API:** For AI generation.
*   **Supabase:** For authentication and license verification.
