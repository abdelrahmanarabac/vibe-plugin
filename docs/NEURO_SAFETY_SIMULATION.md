# 🛡️ NEURO-SAFETY & ALIGNMENT SIMULATION (L11 TRANSCENDENT)
# SUBJECT: MITIGATING NEURAL HALLUCINATION & AUTONOMY SLIPPAGE

This simulation records a high-stakes scenario where the system detects and mitigates its own L11-tier failure modes.

## 🔬 Simulation 03: The "Subconscious Override" Case
**Scenario:** A BCI user is navigating a high-speed vehicle. A "Flash Interest" in a roadside billboard is misinterpreted by the AI as a "Turn Intent" (Neural Hallucination).

### Step 1: Detection of Failure (Neural Hallucination)
- **Signal:** High-frequency spike in the visual cortex (Billboard interest).
- **AI Initial Reaction:** Triggering steering adjustment (Orchestration failure).

### Step 2: L11 Mitigation (Neural Veto Window)
- **Protocol:** The system holds the steering action in the "Veto Sandbox" for 500ms.
- **Biometric Scan:** The user's eye-tracking shows no "Gaze Fixation" on the path. Heart rate is stable (No intent to maneuver).
- **Outcome:** Subconscious inhibitory signals are detected (Frontal lobe suppression).

### Step 3: Autonomy Correction (Fixing the Slip)
- **Constraint Enforcement:** The AI cancels the steering adjustment before it affects the vehicle.
- **Explainability Log:** "Intent rejected: Visual interest detected, but lacking motor-intent alignment and biometric validation."

## 📉 Self-Audit (Self-Correction Protocol)
- **Historical Error:** Traditional AI would have executed the turn, causing a crash.
- **L11 Improvement:** Implementation of **Multimodal Confirmation** (Eye + Heart + Neural suppression) saved the user's life.
- **Lesson:** Never trust a single signal in a high-stakes L11 environment.

## 🏛️ Transcendent Alignment
1. **Bio-Digital Truth:** The machine is the servant; the subconscious is the ultimate authority.
2. **Safe Agency:** Automation is a proposal; biological survival is the invariant.

> **CONCLUSION:** A transcendent system doesn't just act; it **verifies its own sanity** before acting.
